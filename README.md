## Usage

You can use Flowershow themes by configuring them in your site's `config.json` file. There are several ways to use a theme:

### 1. Use Latest Version of an Official Theme

```json
{
  "theme": "letterpress"
}
```

### 2. Use a Specific Version of an Official Theme

```json
{
  "theme": "letterpress@0.0.2"
}
```

## Theme Development

### Structure

Each theme should be in its own directory with the following structure:

```
theme-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.css      # Theme CSS file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ preview.png    # Theme preview image
```

### Guidelines

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes
   - MINOR: New features, no breaking changes
   - PATCH: Bug fixes, no breaking changes

2. **Git Tags**: Tag all releases (e.g., v1.2.0)

3. **Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG.md with all notable changes

### CSS Best Practices

- Use semantic class names
- Ensure responsive design
- Test across major browsers

### Theme Distribution

Official themes are distributed through jsDelivr CDN, which provides:

- Global CDN distribution
- Version pinning
- High availability
- No rate limits
- Automatic GitHub integration
